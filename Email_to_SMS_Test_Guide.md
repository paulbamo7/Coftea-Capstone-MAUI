### **🔧 How to Switch to Another Method:**

If email-to-SMS doesn't work, change this line in `Services/PurchaseOrderSMSService.cs`:

```csharp
// Change from:
private static readonly SMS_METHOD SMS_METHOD = SMS_METHOD.EMAIL_TO_SMS;

// To one of these:
private static readonly SMS_METHOD SMS_METHOD = SMS_METHOD.TEXTLOCAL_API;    // TextLocal (5 min setup)
private static readonly SMS_METHOD SMS_METHOD = SMS_METHOD.CLICKSEND_API;  // ClickSend (5 min setup)
private static readonly SMS_METHOD SMS_METHOD = SMS_METHOD.MESSAGEBIRD_API; // MessageBird (5 min setup)
```

❌ **Not working if:**

### **🚀 Next Steps:**

If you're on Globe or Smart, it should work immediately!
