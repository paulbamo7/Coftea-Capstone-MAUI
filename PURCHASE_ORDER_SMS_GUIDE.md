# üì± Purchase Order SMS Guide

## Overview

The Coftea app automatically sends SMS notifications to suppliers when creating purchase orders. The system uses your **phone's built-in SMS app** (100% FREE - no API keys or setup required).

## üéØ How It Works

### Step-by-Step Flow

1. **Low Stock Detection**
   - Go to Inventory page
   - Items below minimum stock will show in red with alerts
   
2. **Create Purchase Order**
   - Click "Create Purchase Order" button
   - System finds all items below minimum stock
   - Shows confirmation dialog with:
     - List of items needed
     - Quantities required
     - What will happen next

3. **SMS Notification**
   - After confirmation, phone's SMS app opens automatically
   - **Pre-filled with:**
     - Supplier phone number: `+639625068078` (change in code)
     - Purchase order message with all details
   - **You just need to press "Send"**

4. **Message Content**
   ```
   COFTEA PURCHASE ORDER #123
   Date: 2025-10-29 14:30
   Supplier: Coftea Supplier
   
   ITEMS NEEDED:
   ‚Ä¢ Milk - 5 L
   ‚Ä¢ Sugar - 2 kg

```

**Format:** Use international format with `+` prefix
- Philippines: `+639XXXXXXXXX`
- US: `+1XXXXXXXXXX`
- UK: `+44XXXXXXXXXX`

```

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: SMS app doesn't open

**Possible causes:**
- Device doesn't support SMS (like tablets without SIM)
- SMS permission not granted

**Solution:**
- Check if device has SIM card
- Ensure SMS app is installed
- Grant SMS permissions to the app

**Fallback:** System shows alert:
```
SMS Not Available
Your device doesn't support SMS. Please contact the supplier manually.
```

### Issue: Wrong phone number

**Solution:**
1. Open `Services/PurchaseOrderSMSService.cs`
2. Update `SUPPLIER_PHONE` constant
3. Rebuild app

### Issue: Message not sending automatically

**This is normal!** The `PHONE_SMS_APP` method opens your SMS app but **requires manual send**. This is the FREE option.

**If you want automatic sending:**
1. Choose a different SMS method (see table above)
2. Set up API credentials
3. Change `CurrentSMSMethod` in code
4. Rebuild app

### Issue: "Failed to send SMS to supplier"

**Debug steps:**
1. Check debug output in Visual Studio
2. Look for error messages
3. Verify phone number format
4. Ensure SMS app is available

## üîê Privacy & Security

### What data is sent?

- Purchase order number
- Date and time
- List of items and quantities
- Your company name ("COFTEA")

### What is NOT sent?

- ‚ùå User passwords
- ‚ùå Customer data
- ‚ùå Transaction history
- ‚ùå Personal information
- ‚ùå Pricing (optional in message)

### Who receives SMS?

1. **Supplier** - Gets purchase order details
2. **Admin** - Gets notification (employee orders only)

### Can I disable SMS?

Yes! Change to `SIMULATION_ONLY` mode:

```csharp
private static readonly SMS_METHOD CurrentSMSMethod = SMS_METHOD.SIMULATION_ONLY;
```

This will only log to debug output, no actual SMS sent.
